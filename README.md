Your assignment is to implement a class Employee (there is no main method). An Employee has a name (a String), a salary (a double) and a number of years of experience (an integer). Also your class Employee must have a static instance variable to keep track of number of employees. The class Employee must include the following constructors and methods. Save the Employee class in a file called Employee.java and use a test driver called Assignment6.java, which has the main method to create new Employee objects and to test your class. A sample output is shown below. Important Notes: Your class should have exactly the method headers that are described or otherwise your class will not work with the test driver program (Assignment6.java) that is provided. You should never change the test driver program, i.e., Assignment6.java, but instead make changes to Employee class to make it work.
